Framework for a blog that I used to learn EJS and templating concepts

This is part of Angela Yu's course on Web Development. This challenge sought to create the framework for a blog. Navigating to /compose allows the user to create a new post, which is then reflected in abbreviated form on the homepage. Clicking through allows the user to view the full post. The blog itself is not persistent -- databases are in the next lecture! This was a great learning experience, though, for creating new dynamic content within a "live" environment.
